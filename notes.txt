__________

work did:
detector.py is improved, Python Wappalyzer is implemented, wrote the test_detector.py and test results are all good

planner.py is improved, write test_planning_flow.py and test results are good

executors.py is also good

intelligent error classification,recovery strategies etc :
error_classifier.py, retry_manager.py, agent.py
researched common web scraping errors and tried to implement those error handlings in our agent


feedback from deepseek


__________

changed files :

detector
agent
state
planner
requirements


installed packages:

pip install python-wappalyzer



__________

TO DO:

0.1 

add the things to agent step by step and test them (write test cases for each service)


1. 

Import inconsistencies: Some imports reference paths that may not exist (e.g., from utils.api_interceptor import generate_requests_script)
Synchronous user input: Uses input() which may not work in non-interactive environments
Error handling: Some exception handling could be more robust
API-first mode: Partially implemented but may need refinement
Robots.txt check: Very basic implementation
Browser-use integration: Present but may need testing for complex sites


2. 

over all bugs


3. 

ideas in my mind

4. unit testing, stress stesting, performance testing, SAST etc etc etc 


5. split the big codes into services
